The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping.
For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest. 

As another example, comparing various 3D repre- sentations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared.
